        <p>This sucks!</p>
        <p>Day 1 was hard. This morning feels like a punch in the gut. I don't know why it is so hard, but it is. I want to tell this to someone, but I'm not allowed to talk to them. I'm sorry.</p>
        <p>So I go on, pretending to not be affected, pulling out the old masks and acting as if nothing is wrong.</p>
        <p>I know it is Wed. and those aren't the best. Praying for you! 4/9 12.00</p>
        <p>So many questions still race through my head. What happened on Monday or over the weekend. I hope you didn't think I wanted this. I know it was inevitable but it wasn't what I wanted. You never even said...was it something I said or did? I don't know why I keep writing. I guess it helps oddly. You probably won't even think to look here. You have a stronger will than I do and I know you made that promise to yourself... Work can only distract me so long. </p>
        <p>I don't know why I'm writing here. This is dumb but I feel like at some point you'll remember this site and check it out. Maybe I'll have taken all this down already. Words used to flow so easy, talking. Having someone that at least acted like they tolerated my whirlwind thoughts. I don't know why I'm putting this out there. I need to find something to fill my time, this is going to drive me mad</p>
        <p>I decided to stay home today because I can't be around people. My office is dark and lonely. the recent terminations have soured the mood. My team has been broken up. Morale is low. What am I even doing. This isn't getting me anywhere close to where I want to be... HELLLOOOOO!!!</p>
        <p>I just read your email...I know this isn't fun for either of us, I'm sorry if I came across as if it was only hard for me... Yes, I'm also resisting the urge to reply immediately - or even at all...it's probably better to wait some time and try to heal the wound :(. Hang in there, you got this...</p>
