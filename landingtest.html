        <p>This sucks!</p>
        <p>Day 1 was hard. This morning feels like a punch in the gut. I don't know why it is so hard, but it is. I want to tell this to someone, but I'm not allowed to talk to them. I'm sorry.</p>
        <p>So I go on, pretending to not be affected, pulling out the old masks and acting as if nothing is wrong.</p>
        <p>I know it is Wed. and those aren't the best. Praying for you! 4/9 12.00</p>
        <p>So many questions still race through my head. What happened on Monday or over the weekend. I hope you didn't think I wanted this. I know it was inevitable but it wasn't what I wanted. You never even said...was it something I said or did? I don't know why I keep writing. I guess it helps oddly. You probably won't even think to look here. You have a stronger will than I do and I know you made that promise to yourself... Work can only distract me so long. </p>
