                <p>05/08/2025</p>
                <p>2:15 PM - This is the first time that I've wanted to sit down all today and write. I've been extremely anxious. Anxious about tomorrow. Anxious because of certain family coming to town. Anxious about the friendship. I have been waking up at 4:30 in the morning for the last 3-4 days. My mind races during this time. You haven't met most of my family... :) and Ihaven't told you anything about them. That would be interesting if you were to come to the graduation party :D. Very...lively group.</p>
                <p>I've been pulling out the guitar a lot more the last two weeks. Trying to stay away from the sad songs, as much as I can.</p>
                <p>My last episode was 4/12...Almost 30 days ago. Trying to keep it out of my mind, I really am. There isn't anything I can do if my body decides to shut down. How does one 'Not worry'. It seems like it is a very real part of my being. Watch me get some 4'10" girl sitting next to me. That explanation of 'Hey - I sometimes pass out and I need you to catch me..." will go over soooo well.</p>
                <p>My parents are on their way from Charlotte now. I get so much anxiety when my mom comes to town. Pray for me :D.</p>
                <p>Then lastly, getting closer to graduation only makes me more anxious about you not wanting to put up with the effort of being friends anymore. I think that is the worst part is feeling like the dynamic is shifting but not being able to ask about it. Let's see, tomorrow is Friday so you'll be working from home. I guess I was hoping to see you while waiting in the car or, heaven forbid you actually make it over to say hi before graduation. I'm wishin on some big stars - I know. I'm setting myself up for dissappointment because all I really want is a message from you saying, 'good luck' or 'congrats' even. Just something to recognize the day and to let me know you remember(?). It's only been two weeks so I guess it is less about knowing that you remember and I guess more about a sign on whether you've given up...</p>
                <p>I don't know why I set myself up for dissapointment. Ok, I'm going to be positive about it though.</p>
                <p>I hope you are having a good day. Last full Thursday in this weird setup. Get through tonight, get through graduation, then worry about how/when to reach out again. </p>
                <p>10:00 PM - got through the Baccalaureate program without much incident. Saw our old youth pastor from high school.Good times there. So, tomorrow is graduation. One of the biggest days in someone's life. I'd want to share it with all my friends and I have one noticable spot open...and...you wno't be there. Sadness...might as well get through it so I can get on to Saturday and figure out how this thing plays out. </p>
                <p>Hope you have a good night and you get a lot of good sleep. Talk to you soon - I hope!</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>

                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>05/07/2025</p>
                <p>Good morning. Today is your 1:1. Hope those are going better for you. Hope the job situation is treating you well. I'll be praying for you today.</p>
                <p>2:00 PM - I've really had a lot going on today. I woke up around 4:30 again this morning. Can't get back to sleep when that happens. I'm not interested in watching tv or anything I may have done years ago. I just don't want to do anything. Little to no motivation.</p>
                <p>Ok, today is the last Wednesday. I took tomorrow and Friday off so I didn't have to stress with everything going on for graduation and family coming into town. T wanted to take graduation pictures last night. Fun stuff. </p>
                <p>I'm still dealing with potential layoffs. Had interesting conversations with my bosses. Maybe I'll be able to tell you about that soon. We'll see.</p>
                <p>Need to get out and run again tonight. I feel good when I do and I need to train for the 5K.</p>
                <p>Did I write about the dr call I had yesterday? I got a bunch of results from the blood work and I'll need to/want to share that with you. It was interesting but, ultimately, didn't give us anything new.... c'est la vie.</p>
                <p>Tweaking my resume and submitting it to more jobs...Let's see how that goes...</p>
                <p>9:00 PM - I spent more time on work than I wanted to today, but it was to make sure I got everything in a good spot in order to be off tomorrow and Friday. Oh Friday...I still hope you reach out. I will not reach out so I can honor this time we agreed on, but I hope you feel the urge or ask (whichever is fine with me) to reach out. It would suck if I can't share this with my friend. I should be happier that this time is coming to an end - however, I'm still anxious that you will no longer want to keep up the effort of staying friends.... :( sigh.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>05/06/2025</p>
                <p>6:30 AM - 3 days then graduation. 4 days until I find out if we are still friends. Well, actually, liek I've told you, you will always be my friend, so I guess it is 4 days until we find out if I get to talk with my friend... Anywho. a lot going on today so going to get the day kicked off and hopefully can get a bunch under my belt early.</p>
                <p>Have a great day!!</p>
                <p>8:15 AM - I had a calendar reminder that this was the first 2 week mark from us trying to go 2 weeks the first time. hmmm, c'est le vie. Is this going to work out this time? I've been suprisingly optimistic these two weeks. Went from sad and lonely to hopeful again. I have hope. I can't explain it but I do. I have to go into a meeting this morning to discuss a strategy for keeping my guys. I have to start looking at other options for income... I don't know what I'm going to do yet.</p>
                <p>1:00 PM - Just got off the phone with the functional neurologist. He basically said everything looks good and is drastically improving. Still seeing some inflammation from something but not sure what. That is the next step to figure out. So we'll try to attack that. He said the markers for Addison's don't tie out so that isn't likely. My cortisol is well within normal, and may even be a little high now....I wonder if that explains why I want to conquer the moon now... so much caged up energy....ahhhhh. I guess maybe we'll talk about it at some point.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>05/05/2025</p>
                <p>7:30 AM - Wow, I'm feeling it today. I have so many things on my plate at the moment and it would be great to have just one person who cared enough to go past the surface level questions of 'how are you doing?'. No one wants to hear what I have to say. It makes it that much worse when I had a friend that knew when I was having a bad day. I took Thursday and Friday off because....I can't go thorugh Friday withut being able to talk to my friend. this is going to be the roughest stretch. I'm still so terrified that you will have given up all hope and want to be done with me. I also don't want to guilt you into anything either because that isn't how a friendship works.</p>
                <p>3:55 PM - Wow, what a crazy day. I'm closing out our books for month end and there are so many things up in the air still. Headcount being the biggest thing. I was able to get them to put the rightsizing on hold for 6 weeks (+/-). This is giong to be a long 6 weeks. My CIO had a candid talk with me. I think it is inevitable on what needs to happen. Don't love it but maybe this is my final sign to just do what I thought I should do.</p>
                <p>This is the last Monday of this ulitmatum. I know that doesn't mean you will want to talk after this, again, but it was the only hope of it so I have to hold to it. Either way, I'll be here to be a friend whenever you need it.</p>
                <p>We have Bailey's recital tonight. Gotta leave early to head over for that. Also, so many things happening this week for the graduation. I also have some long 10-15 page paper due....boring. :). I'll get home tonight and continue working on that as well as put my resume out to more places.</p>
                <p>You doing ok? How's the job going?</p>
                <p>10:10 PM - I see you online and I want to reach out and say something liek - I passed my BJU class with a B!! Yay!!.I have one paper due this week with my other university class. Then I start the last class on 5/12. Should be interesting. I've hit senioritis hard now though. Little to no motivation to keep up the homework anymore. Who knows, maybe I'll really like the next class.</p>
                <p>Anywho - yeah, another day in the books. If I could tell you anything right now it would be that I do hope we can be friends. I've never had anyone in my life that stopped and tried to be in my life as much as you have. That is rare and I think it is special. Not a weird special but a friendly kind of special and I want to let you know that I appreciate you and your personality, and your kindness, and your openness and honesty. Sigh. Well, I guess this week will tell...</p>
                <p>I've been having that forewarning feeling all week. It's kind of been dull but it is there and it is giving me more anxiety... :| ... I talk to the doctor tomorrow. Watch it be Addison's. I know I said in this before that if it was I was going to reach out regardless... I can't, I just can't willingly throw away this chance, however small to be friends. BUT, you better believe I will message or email you on Saturday (or is it Sunday) with that information.</p>
                <p>Again - kind of hoping you will message or something on Friday. I probably won't message back until Sat or Sun, but it will make my day.</p>
                <p>And this is me foolishly thinking you even check these pages. I know you probably don't. I actually probably know you definitely don't.</p>
                <p>Question for you when all this settles down...were you going to tell N this last time?  I have my reasons for asking and it isn't meant to be that you wouldn't. I'm just curious at this point.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>05/04/2025</p>
                <p>This is the last Sunday before this ultimatum is up. I'd say I've just about fully moved into a mindset that you will [abandon] may not be the right word but leave teh friendship. Everyone has. Maybe I'm trying to hold on too tightly. Still shows my lack of patience. I've say and thought aout the years I've been allive and none of them stood out to me as being lonely, not until this past month or so.</p>
                <p>I've been looking up different things on friendship and the one that has stuck out to me so far is the one that said something like this based on a quote from George Eliot, that friendship is when you experience an "Inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but to pour them all out, just as they are". I think that is what makes me want to be your friend. For the most part, I feel safe being who I am and am not worried that you are going to judge me. I'll have to admit I don't know what these two weeks will bring and fear you will drift away from wanting to be friends. I guess I understand your position but I still don't understand why I would be allowed to open up to someone as a friend to have them taken away.</p>
                <p>I want to sit in the mud with you when you have bad days because, at least it felt like this, I know you are willing to sit in the mud with me. I think because you showed me no judgment and the kindness that I haven't seen my entire life. I think because you fought to some degree to keep me in your life, when no on in my life ever has... I can't finish this without tearing up but - because of this I want to keep you as a friend. No feelings, no bs, just friends. No amount of drama will change that for me and I secretly hope that is the same for you but I have an inner voice that creeps up and tells me I'm too much hassle, I'm too much to ultimately fight for. It EASIER to let me go than it is to fight - I guess I understand that but I still want to have hope...</p>
                <p>It is a good nght to get to bed early. I'm feeling the loneliness.</p>
                <p>Good Night Friend- Sleep Well</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>05/03/2025</p>
                <p>Full day of schoolwork. Been up since about 4:30 and got a haircut around 10:30. I've been working on schoolwork since and I think it is all trash. This is where I normally give it up and take whatever grade I get but I can't do that because I have to pass this class.</p>
                <p>Was just thinking through what you might be thinking. I still want to be friends. I don't have any clue that you do or that you will rather. I miss the conversations and I miss being able to bounce ideas off you. We are looking at businesses to buy. If I can get through this week, I'll finally be able to dedicate some time towards really looking at it.</p>
                <p>I constantly have the feeling of passing out in my gut. It used to be only before but now it is a dull feeling all the time. I'm not sure what that can be or mean. I really don't want to pass out while at graduation...</p>
                <p>Paralyzed by NF just came on. What a song to describe my two years prior to January. What a horrible place to be. Where's the person I know... I am glad I started feeling more but there are some days where I think not feeling is easier... Today is almost that day. Rough weekend ahead and no chance to even bring it up to you for another 7 days.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>5/02/2025</p>
                <p>8:00 AM - Friday morning. Woke up early again. A lot going on in my head. Have you changed your mind yet. Are you still going to want to be friends? This is the question that lives rent free in my head. I've tried to talk to other people for meaningful conversation. It all ends at the small talk and no one wants to have a meaningful conversation. This makes me feel like what I'm saying or want to talk about is uninteresting or I'm just boring. One more week to tell if I still have a friend I guess...well the chance at a friend...I don't even know anymore.</p>
                <p>Get through today and then one more Friday. I'm halfway through two weeks and losing a friend isn't easier today. Am really interested where you got two weeks from ;). Ok, now I guess I have to work.</p>
                <p>2:00 PM - Oh! I forgot to mention. I got all my regaila yesterday!! It's getting real! kids wanted me to try it on :). Almost have everything ready now. I just need to complete two items and I'm done with this BJU class...barely scraping by in it because....I ... I have a reason but not putting it down here.Going to some wedding tonight for one of Tracy's friends or coworkers or something.we'll see how it goes. Thanks for reminding me, I need to sign up for the 5K today.</p>
                <p>3:50 PM - What a day. I've had a hard time with someone at work and I'm not sure why. I am getting more and more discouraged by it and trying to keep from spiraling. I don't know. I just don't know.</p>
                <p>10:20 PM - What a whirlwind of a day. I was told I have to make more cuts at work. I don't know what I'm going to do if that is the case. I can't process everything with fewer people. Oh to be able to talk this through...</p>
                <p>I'm going to bed in a minute because I'm tired and I can't stay up to finish my homework. I'm going to get online early and knock the rest of it out. Got a haircut at 10:30 and I wanted to clean up the yard for next weekends Grad party. Guess I'm trying to speak, er type, it into being but I do wish you would message me next Friday morning to wish me luck and congratulate me. It would be awesome! I also have to get this thought of passing out as far from my mind as possible. We'll be going on 3 weeks and it is waaaayyy to close for comfort. I've been getting that feeling in my guy, but it stays for a long while - So I'm anxious and on edge.</p>
                <p>I need sleep - it's been a rough day. Have a good night - I'm still praying for you and your family.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>5/01/2025</p> 
                <p>6:30 AM - Good morning. I got some good sleep last night. Only woke up at 4:30...Today starts billing at work. I have to be in the office for billing so this will be interesting. First time I've had to do this since having this team. Was on line last night working with them until 10:30 or so. </p> 
                <p>Ok, get through today, then one more Thursday. I can do this. I have to admit i'm starting to worry you won't want to be friends anymore after this period and that hurts already. Kind of glad you can't see this page because I'm not trying to guilt you into anything, however it's gonna suck if that's the case. Not in the sense that 'I spent so much time investing' but from the sense that 'I opened up and let someone in as a friend and they got ripped away'. I guess I'm just trying to hold on to something that was the first good thing in a while.</p> 
                <p>I try to make connections with other people, but the conversations seem so shallow. I'm so tired of small talk and people only coming by to get their business question answered. I miss talk that broadens thinking and encourages me to be better. </p> 
                <p>Ok, on with the day. Let's see what it brings</p>
                <p>12:35PM - Man, what a day at work so far. I am spiraling. Today more than ever. I don't know what to do and I have no one to talk to (not an issue for you - seriously. Just wish that existed). I'm to the point where maybe I was supposed to leave a month or two ago and I didn't so this is showing up because I should have left. I am so far down today I don't know which way is up. I feel like a diver that has gone until there isn't any light visible and I'm frantically swimming in different directions with no hope. I knew 2025 was going to be a year of loss but I guess I didn't know how bad it would be. How do I change that? I don't know.</p>
                <p>I don't know why I'm broken like this</p>
                <p>9:30OPM - Goodness what a day.Bad day at work. ridiculous coworker and just frustration all around from that. It's EOM so I'm home kicking off billing...Just need to make sure it runs properly tonight and could be running well into the morning.</p>
                <p>We had B3's soccer game. Went out to IHOP before that...kids love it - it's ok food, not the best but I've had worse. Usually just stick to the eggs and breakfast meats.</p>
                <p>Anywho, made it through this Thursday. Get through tomorrow and we start to see single digits/last days before 2 big things I guess - 1. Graduation & 2. end of this prescribed period. I still worry you will tell me it isn't worth it and you don't want to put up with it. that's my insecurity I guess. I don't even know how to reach out and fear I don't reach out and just let you reach out first. Then what if you don't reach out? I don't know if this is off the table now but I went to the mailbox today because I would love to find a graduation card in there. </p>
                <p>Went out to walk around today and saw Sarah walking down the street. She said things are really bad where she is and she might start looking for something else. I think I need to as well. I just don't know where I would want to go. I want to start something on my own and just need to figure out exactly what I want that to be.</p>
                <p>Ok, now I need to finish my big project so I can work in the yard on Saturday. My truck also isn't starting again - I don't know why I haven't just sold it already. I'll either be on later or tomorrow. Night!</p>
                <p>10:00 PM - Well, that didn't last long. I've been waking up at 4-4:30 this last week and I'm tired so I'm going to bed. Got this billing running in the background so hopefully everything keeps going all night long. Get through tomorrow and one more of every day...That is unless I need to go through two Saturdays.</p>
                <p>Part of me hopes you'll reach out next Friday to just say congrats. I will acknowledge if you do but I fully intent to go back to the blackout until SDaturday or Sunday....Just knowing you remember it and want to wish a congrats is, er would be awesome.</p>
                <p>Ok, I'm going to fall asleep at my desk if I don't go. Praying for you still. Hope everything has been going alright for you. - Good Night!</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/30/2025</p> 
                <p>6:00 AM - Get through today and one more Wednesday...</p>
                <p>I couldn't sleep. I am assuming you probably couldn't sleep either. May be why I say you were active on LI at 1AM and 4AM (ish). Everything ok? I'm here if you need anything. I hate that your mind is racing about something.</p>
                <p>11:30AM - Well, I guess the morning is going by pretty quickly. I've got too much to do today. I have to finish my review and I suck at selling myself on these things. Then I have to start the month end billing process. First time since my lead is gone. We'll see how that goes.</p>
                <p>Trying to find something to keep my mind occupied with while working. Seen you've been busy on LI, look at you go. How are you putting together your content? The one you posted today reminds me of a book I read recently but I can't put my finger on it.</p>
                <p>I would love to go to lunch with someone today. I've got noone in the office today and I'm probably going to have to pick something fast - which is kind of blah sometimes. We didn't have life group this week since most folks were out of town. I don't think we have anything to do tonight and I need to work late - blah again.</p>
                <p>10:25PM - wow, a 3 hour planning session with a ton of directors really makes the day fly by. I don't know how it is already past 10PM. I'm glad since I got through the Wednesday. On to Thursday. getting so close to single digits on this goal. I wanted to know how that new role was panning out. Are you going to lean into it more and put together what J is asking for? I think you should.</p>
                <p>Have you figured out what kind of business you are going to put together? How are you going to get your first customer?</p>
                <p>I am winding down work for school and I'm really wanting to explore options to branch out on my own even more. Got officially finished with the internship and finished with an A - yay! I have two more items for each of my other classes and then I can walk with only one outstanding class. Yay Again!</p>
                <p>I'm kind of bummed that I won't be able to ceebrate graduation with you at all - not that it would be more than a celebratory text :), but still. </p>
                <p>What else happened today? Because my team lead is gone, I had to work work until 10:30....that brings me here trying to revamp some things on this site. Guess I'll take a little bit of time to play around updating this.</p> 
                <p>I added some cool features on the backend, I'll share the next time we can talk. Even if that is in 20 years... :| </p> 
                <p></p> 
                <p></p> 
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/29/2025</p> 
                <p>Good morning! It's an ok morning. I'm writing this to you, yes, but it helps keep me from reaching out. You said 2 weeks, over and over as if it was some magic number to keep from thinking about this all the time. I still think it sucks to lose a friend and I don't know how long it will continue to suck. Get through today and only need one more tuesday</p>
                <p>We have a choir recital to go to tonight. I ran last night and started the paper that is due this week. That took up a good portion of my night. I only laid in bed scrolling on my dumb phone for about 5 minutes before I was too tired to hold it up</p>
                <p>Get through today and one more Tuesday....Get through today. I got this.</p>
                <p>8:22 AM - Oh man, what am I doing? What am I doing? Rereading things isn't good for this, especially not at day 3. And just the start to the day as well... I hate to keep saying this is hard, but this is most definitely not easy. I'm feeling the feels on this. Happy now? ;)</p>
                <p>9:45 AM - Praying for you today. I hope your day is going alright. No, I hope your day is great! You have a lot going on and I hope you can get it all done. I hope you can figure out that business you wanted to start. I hope you can be successful. ...</p>
                <p>1:00 PM - Just got back from lunch. I've been feeling it in my gut today. It's that feeling...the one where I don't know if I'm going to need to lay down because I'll 'fall asleep'. What is going on? I wish I had even the slightest inkling. It'd be nice to have the ability to talk today. Grrrr</p>
                <p>Why is today dragging so much? Hey did I tell you we are doing the 5K at the school. You should join. (Yes I'm fully aware you don't remember this site and won't ever see this. It's better than messaging you though)</p>
                <p>It tears me up...Did you think I would be able to do this? 2 weeks huh...I'm going to hate it if I make it thru the 2 weeks and you dn't want to keep the friendship going. I don't think you'll see this so I'm good with saying it. I wouldn't say that to you because I'm big on not trying to pressure you (or anyone) into something that I want. And...right now, I want to be friends with you. sigh. I do. and I don't know</p>
                <p>Now I start to question why you wanted to be friends in the first place. Mostly because I've never had anyone fight, figuratively speaking, to be friends. My mind jumps to 'Why would anyone want that? And if they truly did, won't that just fade over 2 weeks (? I don't really know - it's never happened so I don't know what a real friendship looks like). I've known a lot of good people, I've known a few people I want to be around and be part of their group, but none of them have expressed that they want to be part of my group. This feels pathetic. I don't know if I'll remind you of this page or not after we talk next...</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/28/2025</p> 
                <p>Monday morning. I need to get through today then I only have one more Monday to get through. I got this. Woke up a little late today, kids took forever to get their stuff. T was mad and forget stuff at home...I don't like not being able to drive :(. I have a lot to keep my mind busy today. Then we have Bryson's first soccer game tonight so a full day of things to do.</p>
                <p>10:30AM - Just went over to the new building with the IT guys. It looks pretty cool. We are going to have a lot of cool perks. I have a window desk in the corner of spring and court street. Had a pretty bad/crappy dream last night. I didn't wake up feeling sore or tired so it was probably just the dream - idk.</p>
                <p>So, with all those layoffs, we have more people being hired...Some interns... ;).... oh man, those interns.</p>
                <p>I've been getting through a bit this morning. Work is coming pretty easily and quickly. I needed that today. </p>
                <p>I am having to deal with Day 2 today. Not as bad as the last Day 2 but still - so much I want to talk about and share. I've got a little schoolwork tonight but have B3's soccer game tonight. The kids want to go to IHOP tonight...(blah) :D.</p>
                <p>Was just thinking about this from the text the other day. You asked if I felt ok on Friday. Honestly, as soon as I thought it was going downhill, I started getting 'sick' thinking this was never even remotely going to happen...that on top of everything else from that day/week, I probably did look sick...Hopefully we can discuss in two weeks or at some point.</p>
                <p>Well, gonna sign up to do a 5K on 5/17. Might as well since I run every night. see how this goes :|. :D  - - It's the one at the school...then we will hit my sister's pool after that.</p>
                <p>Speaking of pools - the pool opens this weekend, that should be good for some distraction this week.</p>
                <p> I'm so afraid I'm going to be looking back through old messages and accidently like something you said or comment something random, or a complete book, on accident ;). I can do this. I can hold off to be friends down the road.</p>
                <p>1:20PM - Just got back from lunch. Had to walk to the bank to pay our car taxes...had chicken for lunch - I know - surprise surprise!</p>
                <p>3:20 PM - A Tear In Space just came on. That hit me hard...too hard. I'm feeling it now. What happens after two weeks? Are we even going to be friends? I mean, I know I want to be friends. I guess I'm just not sure I've had anyone express that they've wanted to be friends before and that kind of threw me when you first said it. I don't know. Now I'm getting in my own head. Let's see where we are at two weeks.</p>
                <p>Ran two miles tonight. Looking at that 5K so I need to run further or faster over the coming week or two to get up to speed. Graduation is next Friday! that is crazy. 20 something years in the making and it's almost here. Not completely done with school and working on the paper that is due this week....Good distraction - sometimes not good enough but good distraction nonetheless</p>
                <p>10:30 - wrapping up homework for the day. Forgot to say this earlier...T is making fun of me today... She messaged and said "I waved to H today lol". I told her she was wierd because she has waived to a lot of people all the time. Why did she feel the need to tell me this one? She just said she thought it was funny because of everything going on...so... :D I'm laughing at it but - oh brother.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/27/2025</p> 
                <p>Woke up this morning - feeling good. I'm down 25lbs. Not going to hit the 50lb goal but hoping to try to drop another 10 by graduation. I have renewed hope that we can be friends. Just get through these 2 weeks and there's nothing to it - right?</p>
                <p>Going to North Hills this morning. Have to talk to one of the pastors to renew our membership since we were gone for 2+ years. Should be a good day overall.</p>
                <p>Have 2 papers to finish for today, 1 paper & 1 exam I need to finish for this upcoming week, then one 10-15 page paper I need to complete next week and I'm done with these classes. Crazy. Then there is one more class left to take. A lot riding on this week...maybe that is why I can't talk to you, so I focus on my schoolwork...I didn't think you were THAT much of a distraction LOL.</p>
                <p>Get through today and there's only one more Sunday to get through...I got this.</p>
                <p>Why am I sooo anxious today? I have literally felt like I'm in fight mode all morning. I'm sure my schoolwork has a little to play into that but I've got plenty of time today. I haven't even been procrastinating. I just feel it all in my gut. You would probably be able to pinpoint it with a few questions...never was sure how you did that...</p>
                <p>One of the papers I have is a review of the internship. Man, you left a lot of little memories all over the place - Cpt. Sparkles. It was a good time. A lot of being able to help everyone and I enjoyed just about every minute of it. 12 days until graduation, 13 days until....(shrugs) I guess we'll see.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think back on whether you told me you were going to the art show or not...I thought I remember you saying you would be out of town or I completely didn't hear what you said at all... Maybe the latter, T says I can't ever hear anything - IDK.</p>
                <p>You asked me how I'd do with it if it didn't turn out favorably...:( I keep coming back to, I brushed the dust off those doors and opened them up. I wouldn't love it, I wouldn't even like it or want to pretend to like it. I can't force it to happen - so while it might suck more than anything - we know I'll eventually be alright. At some point down the road, I think it will happen.</p>
                <p>My question will be, can I wish you happy BDay? Can I interact with you on LI? All these things that I consider to be humans interacting with each other, am I just not going to be allowed to interact with you??????</p>
                <p>Almost through the first Sunday. Going to go run in a minute and then finish and turn in this last paper due today... Met with one of the elders at church so we can continue to be members at North Hills.it was a good meeting.</p>
                <p>Got some stuff going on that I don't know how to deal with. Would love to talk through it. Maybe this is the list we talk through in 2 weeks...hopefully.... fingers crossed. - I just want to feel like everything I do isn't criticized by people.</p>
                <p>Ok, One of the two Sundays under my belt. I hope you are doing ok. It was good to talk to you yesterday and get the update of how things were really from Friday night.</p>
                <p>9:30PM - Time for bed. First Sunday in the bags. Night</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/26/2025</p> 
                <p>Well, we saw you guys at the art show last night. Probably haven't felt that uncomfortable for some time. It was obvious there was not a single ounce that wanted to talk to me or be in that situation from someone. :(. Hope is fading. I'm trying to be ok with it. I truly am. T is great about it. She says I haven't been myself for the last two years and the last few months have been good. I think it is because I opened myself up. That comes with a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Once you open something that hasn't been opened for a while, something has to rush in. Right now, I need to find something to fill that space. It is currently being occupied by loneliness and sadness. i told this to A. I think he is going to be a good one. :) So much pulled out in the first session already.</p>
                <p>I sent you an email, then I recalled it...I am not sure you wanted it</p>
                <p>Just got a Teams message from you. Things make more sense on a lot of fronts. </p>
                <p>It was great talking to you today. I have so much more I want to tell you</p>
                <p>Therapy was Friday. We hit a number of things right out of the gate. Think there is a good game plan going forward. You wouldn't be surprised by some of it. I'm too skeptical to think any one person is always right but Im starting to wonder...</p>
                <p>Ok, so ironically, this ultimatum (is that the right word) is the same thing we just tried, but this feels different. This is a goal and I obliterate goals. This fuels me and it will be worth it in the end. Again though, funny that it's the same thing we tried and failed at 3 days in...</p>
                <p>Get through today then two more Saturdays. I won't reach out until at least 5/11... I won't reach out... I've got this.</p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/25/2025</p>
                <p>Saw Adam today. had some good conversations. I know emailing you wasn't what you wanted. I am not expecting you to write back. I just feel lonely for the first time in my life. How does coming out of whatever the last two years into this feeling...how is that supposed to feel ok, or normal? I'm glad I switched (back to the Adam part) I think this session went super quick but had good results already.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/24/2025</p> 
                <p>Ok, I made it through yesterday without reaching out. This will be hard but the selfish part of me wants to question, how will I know when, or even IF, I can reach out again...if ever? All the dumb things I want to say to someone and they are too dumb for most people to have time for...I guess you never probably had time for them either but you entertained them :D. I miss being able to just throw those in chat and let a conversation play out.</p>
                <p>They let another round of people go from work. I don't know why they could have done it all at the same time. Completely killing the moral of the office everytime this happens and it's now been twice in a 2-week period.</p>
                <p>I guess we are going to the art show on Friday. Second oldest says she has a piece that is entered and so we'll be there. Also, little man starts up soccer on Monday with the school. Guess it is going to be a busy week.</p>
                <p>I'm so unmotivated today</p>
                <p>God's delays are not necessarily denials....:(</p>
                <p>Don't waste the waiting...Please act on my behalf as I wait on you...</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
               
                
                <p>4/23/2025</p>
                <p>Ok, I archived the rest of this. Figured I would start over since I'm in a different headspace. I'm sad. Not distraught or anything... but sad.</p>
                <p>I tried to stop and think about this from another approach. What’s the worst that could happen after some time of not talking? So I'll write through that.</p>
                <p>In my mind, the worst that could happen is that you forget about me, and we’re never friends again, and I never find another friend who’s easy to talk to and understands my quirks :). Is that unrealistic? Maybe... I just know it takes a lot for me to let anyone past that circle of acquaintances. I let you in and now I have to intentionally keep you out. That feels like ripping out a piece of me. Maybe that is dramatic but it's honest. I guess the next worse thing is we are able to continue talking and you find out I'm boring. Then we were able to talk but you don't want to. Goes back to losing a friend, or I guess what I thought was a friend. Still the same amount of hurt and opening myself up to be hurt. I don't like that. It doesn't feel good.</p>
                <p>You say two weeks and it will feel better. Again, it isn't about being sad, it's about finding a friend that I let in, that I can't be friends with. I don't know how long that feeling will last. There are a lot of aquaintances that are nice to hang out with and nice to have around...</p>
                <p>Got the bloodwork done yesterday. I have hope that they will find something with this. If this is Addison's - I'm reaching out...Screw anything - I'm reaching out. </p>
                <p>12:32PM - I'm here at work, trying to find something INTERESTING to keep me occupied. I can do all this work I just want to be jovial with someone. Ok, what do I need to do....tonight when I get home, I need to start 3 large papers. probably not all at once but finding that motiviation is extremely hard today. I keep hoping you'll reach out with an update. It's only been 1 full day so far though. </p>
                <p>I've gone to lunch alone before - today seems different. Listening to Coldplay - Fix you...seems sad enough without getting too far off that cliff.</p>
                <p>1:39PM - back from lunch. Thinking you are getting ready for your 1:1. praying for you. Feeling off right now, hoping I clear the rest of the day. I have an eye appointment around 4 then need to fill my evening with things to do for school and getting ready for the weekend.</p>
                <p>3:32PM - praying for you, right now. Thinking about that one thing you mentioned that I wasn't quite sure about (hadn't ever thought about it before). Listening to videos on it. Not sure I follow how I resemble that but should have asked you if you saw that.</p>
