                <h3>Daily Log - I guess</h3>
                <p>4/11/2025</p>
                <p>It's 12:47AM. I'm still up. I finished writing this response to your last email. Somehow I fear it will be the last email. I don't dare say that but there is a part of me that thinks that. I'll send the email I have for you in the morning when I wake up. Maybe I should just start getting up when I wake up at 4 and go running. It needs to be a little warmer in the morning and I'll go run up and down this main road... hopefully no one is driving dangerously at that time of the morning ;). Good night. I'll post more later in the morning.</p>
                <p>Sent you the email. On morning standup. Feel better than I did on Tuesday morning so that is a win. I know there are so many things I would tell you this morning but I either hold it back or put some things here. sigh...</p>
                <p>Your last email...what are you trying to do to me :). I can't work if I can't see. Very sweetly worded email. Thank you.</p>
                <p>Alright, it happened. I just broke down. I won't tell you this in email and I'm not confident you even remember this page but...I won't reach out to you again until you reach out first. Take all the time and space you need. I will miss our connection in whatever time it takes to come back. Thank you again for everything.</p>
                <p>Trying to keep myself from more loss...Losing friends, and losing friends, losing jobs that I like, losing health, losing myself. Everything within me wants to hold on tightly to everything...I don't know how to process it all the right way. Letting go is the only thing I know to do. It hurts, I think mostly because I don't know if I will ever get it back.</p>
                <p>I need to reformat this page...If I do come in here every day, this could get ugly. Standby</p>
                <p>I guess I'm going to try to run again tonight. Might as well.</p>
                <p>Praying for you and hoping you have a good weekend!</p>
                <p>How is your proposal for a new role coming? I want to know so bad...Were you able to get an answer on what J is looking for? Have you submitted a followup proposal? Can't wait to hear about htis in 6 months... sorry - too soon...</p>
                <p>hmmm, well, i'm not sure how to respond to that... :'(. I just want this to be over. I just don't know anymore. </p>
                <p>I almost didn't do an internship...this gut punch wouldn't be here right now if that was the case... Do I ever choose right? </p>
                <p>I don't know if it is too late to run or not but I don't know if I'll get any sleep. I'm in the middle of a stressful week to begin with. Mounds of schoolwork and these classes are ones I have to pass. How does one know they made the right decisions? I know I need to work on getting my schoolwork done so tomorrow afternoon isn't a mad dash to the finish line but I'm tired. Physically and emotionally.</p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/10/2025</p>
                <p>It's been a morning already. Today is the day I have this termination. I felt disingenuous saying "Let's have a good day" on our morning standup. 
                <p>I didn't wake up with that gut punch feeling this morning but there is still a hole. It's obvious, I don't know if that is because I was able to get that email out on what I needed to say or not.</p>
                <p>A lot more I wanted to say in that email. I wanted to tell you all the happenings in life and what we decided for next steps on my condition. I wanted to let you know what happened at life group, in regards to the condition. I wanted to let you know I was thinking and praying for your because it was Wednesday and I know those aren't easy for you.</p>
                <p>Ran last night, got about 3 miles in before it got too late and cold. Running seems to wear my body out so I can sleep. A lot of time to think and process things</p>
                <p>I figured out how to redirect the different links I sent you to all come to one page. it's easier to maintain this way. :) Always learning - or trying to anyways</p>
                <p>Meetings meetings everywhere</p>
                <p>I feel dumb just throwing this out here. I don't know if it will ever be seen. I guess I write here instead of opening up teams. I deleted the history of our chat so I wouldn't go back and think about it. I guess that helps.</p>
                <p>I'm still curious what part of your story you were unhappy with or wanted changed. Also, why did you want to know about the 10 questions. You said you were questioning everything...I'm sorry you are questioning everything. What are you questioning?</p>
                <p>Going out with the team to lunch. Kind of feels pointless putting this here. I would tell you about how life group was good and what we talked about. How it felt directly applicable at this moment. Losing careers and friends. Both seem to be where I'm at. Trying to see where I'm supposed to go from here because I would sprint there...</p>
                <p>Tried to limit the sad music yesterday. Found some new stuff. Got some suggestions from peeps at work, although - some of it was weird - not gonna lie. Some group called Surfaces. I can't get into it. They maybe had one track worth listening to..</p>
                <p>Got 2 miles in tonight. Running is starting to feel normal and is a good relaxer. It's helping me move towards the goal of losing that 50 before graduation. I'm just over 20 down and might have to double down to get the full 50. But it helps with processing things.</p>
                <p>I got your email today. I know you meant it to be hopeful. I see it as lacing my shoes for a long uphill run. I would love to stop and think about 6 months from now. But like in the email I'll send in the morning, I'm still putting one foot in front of the other for now. Never too hopeful. Cautious of being dissapointed.</p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>4/9/2025</p>
                <p>I figured you'd get back here eventually. This sucks. I appreciated everything you've done. You won't be forgotten. Thank you, again, for everything. Reach out when you can...</p>
                <p>Day 1 was hard. This morning feels like a punch in the gut. I don't know why it is so hard, but it is. I want to tell this to someone, but I'm not allowed to talk to them. I'm sorry.</p>
                <p>So I go on, pretending to not be affected, pulling out the old masks and acting as if nothing is wrong.</p>
                <p>I know it is Wed. and those aren't the best. Praying for you! 4/9 12.00</p>
                <p>So many questions still race through my head. What happened on Monday or over the weekend. I hope you didn't think I wanted this. I know it was inevitable but it wasn't what I wanted. You never even said...was it something I said or did? I don't know why I keep writing. I guess it helps oddly. You probably won't even think to look here. You have a stronger will than I do and I know you made that promise to yourself... Work can only distract me so long. </p>
                <p>I don't know why I'm writing here. This is dumb but I feel like at some point you'll remember this site and check it out. Maybe I'll have taken all this down already. Words used to flow so easy, talking. Having someone that at least acted like they tolerated my whirlwind thoughts. I don't know why I'm putting this out there. I need to find something to fill my time, this is going to drive me mad</p>
                <p>I decided to stay home today because I can't be around people. My office is dark and lonely. the recent terminations have soured the mood. My team has been broken up. Morale is low. What am I even doing. This isn't getting me anywhere close to where I want to be... HELLLOOOOO!!!</p>
                <p>I just read your email...I know this isn't fun for either of us, I'm sorry if I came across as if it was only hard for me... Yes, I'm also resisting the urge to reply immediately - or even at all...it's probably better to wait some time and try to heal the wound :(. Hang in there, you got this...</p>
                <p>Made it through the first work day. I have things to occupy me tonight. Schoolwork (gotta try to at least pass this class with a C), then I might double up on the miles tonight again. I came home last night and completely crashed after my shower. Trade one pain for another... Have a good night!</p>
