                <h2>Daily Log</h2>
                <p>4/24/2025</p> 
                <p>Ok, I made it through yesterday without reaching out. This will be hard but the selfish part of me wants to question, how will I know when, or even IF, I can reach out again...if ever? All the dumb things I want to say to someone and they are too dumb for most people to have time for...I guess you never probably had time for them either but you entertained them :D. I miss being able to just throw those in chat and let a conversation play out.</p>
                <p>They let another round of people go from work. I don't know why they could have done it all at the same time. Completely killing the moral of the office everytime this happens and it's now been twice in a 2-week period.</p>
                <p>I guess we are going to the art show on Friday. Second oldest says she has a piece that is entered and so we'll be there. Also, little man starts up soccer on Monday with the school. Guess it is going to be a busy week.</p>
                <p>I'm so unmotivated today</p>
                <p>God's delays are not necessarily denials....:(</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
               
                
                <p>4/23/2025</p>
                <p>Ok, I archived the rest of this. Figured I would start over since I'm in a different headspace. I'm sad. Not distraught or anything... but sad.</p>
                <p>I tried to stop and think about this from another approach. What’s the worst that could happen after some time of not talking? So I'll write through that.</p>
                <p>In my mind, the worst that could happen is that you forget about me, and we’re never friends again, and I never find another friend who’s easy to talk to and understands my quirks :). Is that unrealistic? Maybe... I just know it takes a lot for me to let anyone past that circle of acquaintances. I let you in and now I have to intentionally keep you out. That feels like ripping out a piece of me. Maybe that is dramatic but it's honest. I guess the next worse thing is we are able to continue talking and you find out I'm boring. Then we were able to talk but you don't want to. Goes back to losing a friend, or I guess what I thought was a friend. Still the same amount of hurt and opening myself up to be hurt. I don't like that. It doesn't feel good.</p>
                <p>You say two weeks and it will feel better. Again, it isn't about being sad, it's about finding a friend that I let in, that I can't be friends with. I don't know how long that feeling will last. There are a lot of aquaintances that are nice to hang out with and nice to have around...</p>
                <p>Got the bloodwork done yesterday. I have hope that they will find something with this. If this is Addison's - I'm reaching out...Screw anything - I'm reaching out. </p>
                <p>12:32PM - I'm here at work, trying to find something INTERESTING to keep me occupied. I can do all this work I just want to be jovial with someone. Ok, what do I need to do....tonight when I get home, I need to start 3 large papers. probably not all at once but finding that motiviation is extremely hard today. I keep hoping you'll reach out with an update. It's only been 1 full day so far though. </p>
                <p>I've gone to lunch alone before - today seems different. Listening to Coldplay - Fix you...seems sad enough without getting too far off that cliff.</p>
                <p>1:39PM - back from lunch. Thinking you are getting ready for your 1:1. praying for you. Feeling off right now, hoping I clear the rest of the day. I have an eye appointment around 4 then need to fill my evening with things to do for school and getting ready for the weekend.</p>
                <p>3:32PM - praying for you, right now. Thinking about that one thing you mentioned that I wasn't quite sure about (hadn't ever thought about it before). Listening to videos on it. Not sure I follow how I resemble that but should have asked you if you saw that.</p>
                <p></p>
               
                <p>What We Don't Say</p>
                <p>I lost a friend today, though not to death</p>
                <p>no final breath, no flowers laid.</p>
                <p>We’re both still here, just far apart,</p>
                <p>a quiet space that boundaries made.</p>
                <p>~~~</p>
                <p>No shouting fight, no shattered trust,</p>
                <p>just softer lines we drew instead.</p>
                <p>A word unsaid, a call not placed,</p>
                <p>a silence where we used to thread.</p>
                <p>~~~</p>
                <p>We laughed like wind through open trees,</p>
                <p>we spoke like songs without a key.</p>
                <p>But life grew thick with complicated steps,</p>
                <p>and fences rose between you and me.</p>
                <p>~~~</p>
                <p>I miss the ease, the thoughtless days,</p>
                <p>the way we'd talk until the night.</p>
                <p>Now even kindness feels too close,</p>
                <p>and reaching out no longer feels right.</p>
                <p>~~~</p>
                <p>So here we are - not enemies</p>
                <p>just strangers trained to stay away.</p>
                <p>I lost a friend today, not out of hate</p>
                <p>but simply choosing a different way.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
