                <p>Okay, let's start this. Not sure where this will go but want to get everything written down</p>
                <p>Vinod, it's been a year, 5 months and 2 days since you left this world. I still remember getting the call from Kevin to talk through this and I still can't believe it. That weekend was a hard one to go through. I knew I had to go into work on Monday and when we were supposed to see you after being back... your office was empty. There was a very somber mood in the office and it was very difficult to do anything.</p>
                <p>I remember you always being willing to talk to whoever needed it and for however long. I don't know if it was compassion or if you really didn't want to do your work :). Maybe the compassion was your work. I remember you being in your office, long after the noise on the floor was over. Your 2AM emails - always asking where things were getting blocked and why. I also remember our talks though. I didn't feel like I could do anything right. I was hired to do a job that I wasn't being allowed to do. You were a safe space to vent and voice my true opions. You either listened or told me where my thinking was flawed without criticism.... unless I was thick headed - then I totally get that. You were a safe place to rest from the battles of servicing. As silly as that sounds. I enjoyed our talks.</p>
                <p>Just so difficult trying to put into words the fact that I miss you being around to talk to. I miss the encouragement you provided. I know you weren't perfect and even what your daughter said at your funeral made me want to be better. I know they wanted you home more as a father and you even said yourself life isn't about working late hours.... idk</p>
                <p>You have no clue the weight I have on my chest when I even think about you and it isn't fair that I have to carry this! Dang it! I dn't think it would have been so bad if you hadn't been so nice and encouraging. Dang it Vinod! I had a plan and you were the only one I knew trying to help me with that. I hate that you're gone! I hate that. I hate you for leaving me alone to deal with this!</p>
                <p>Dang it!</p>
                <p>Dang it Vinod!</p>
                <p>Dang it...</p>
