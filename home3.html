                <p>I couldn't sleep. I am assuming you probably couldn't sleep either. May be why I say you were active on LI at 1AM and 4AM (ish). Everything ok? I'm here if you need anything. I hate that your mind is racing about something.</p>

                <p>4/29/2025</p> 
                <p>Good morning! It's an ok morning. I'm writing this to you, yes, but it helps keep me from reaching out. You said 2 weeks, over and over as if it was some magic number to keep from thinking about this all the time. I still think it sucks to lose a friend and I don't know how long it will continue to suck. Get through today and only need one more tuesday</p>
                <p>We have a choir recital to go to tonight. I ran last night and started the paper that is due this week. That took up a good portion of my night. I only laid in bed scrolling on my dumb phone for about 5 minutes before I was too tired to hold it up</p>
                <p>Get through today and one more Tuesday....Get through today. I got this.</p>
                <p>8:22 AM - Oh man, what am I doing? What am I doing? Rereading things isn't good for this, especially not at day 3. And just the start to the day as well... I hate to keep saying this is hard, but this is most definitely not easy. I'm feeling the feels on this. Happy now? ;)</p>
                <p>9:45 AM - Praying for you today. I hope your day is going alright. No, I hope your day is great! You have a lot going on and I hope you can get it all done. I hope you can figure out that business you wanted to start. I hope you can be successful. ...</p>
                <p>1:00 PM - Just got back from lunch. I've been feeling it in my gut today. It's that feeling...the one where I don't know if I'm going to need to lay down because I'll 'fall asleep'. What is going on? I wish I had even the slightest inkling. It'd be nice to have the ability to talk today. Grrrr</p>
                <p>Why is today dragging so much? Hey did I tell you we are doing the 5K at the school. You should join. (Yes I'm fully aware you don't remember this site and won't ever see this. It's better than messaging you though)</p>
                <p>It tears me up...Did you think I would be able to do this? 2 weeks huh...I'm going to hate it if I make it thru the 2 weeks and you dn't want to keep the friendship going. I don't think you'll see this so I'm good with saying it. I wouldn't say that to you because I'm big on not trying to pressure you (or anyone) into something that I want. And...right now, I want to be friends with you. sigh. I do. and I don't know</p>
                <p>Now I start to question why you wanted to be friends in the first place. Mostly because I've never had anyone fight, figuratively speaking, to be friends. My mind jumps to 'Why would anyone want that? And if they truly did, won't that just fade over 2 weeks (? I don't really know - it's never happened so I don't know what a real friendship looks like). I've known a lot of good people, I've known a few people I want to be around and be part of their group, but none of them have expressed that they want to be part of my group. This feels pathetic. I don't know if I'll remind you of this page or not after we talk next...</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/28/2025</p> 
                <p>Monday morning. I need to get through today then I only have one more Monday to get through. I got this. Woke up a little late today, kids took forever to get their stuff. T was mad and forget stuff at home...I don't like not being able to drive :(. I have a lot to keep my mind busy today. Then we have Bryson's first soccer game tonight so a full day of things to do.</p>
                <p>10:30AM - Just went over to the new building with the IT guys. It looks pretty cool. We are going to have a lot of cool perks. I have a window desk in the corner of spring and court street. Had a pretty bad/crappy dream last night. I didn't wake up feeling sore or tired so it was probably just the dream - idk.</p>
                <p>So, with all those layoffs, we have more people being hired...Some interns... ;).... oh man, those interns.</p>
                <p>I've been getting through a bit this morning. Work is coming pretty easily and quickly. I needed that today. </p>
                <p>I am having to deal with Day 2 today. Not as bad as the last Day 2 but still - so much I want to talk about and share. I've got a little schoolwork tonight but have B3's soccer game tonight. The kids want to go to IHOP tonight...(blah) :D.</p>
                <p>Was just thinking about this from the text the other day. You asked if I felt ok on Friday. Honestly, as soon as I thought it was going downhill, I started getting 'sick' thinking this was never even remotely going to happen...that on top of everything else from that day/week, I probably did look sick...Hopefully we can discuss in two weeks or at some point.</p>
                <p>Well, gonna sign up to do a 5K on 5/17. Might as well since I run every night. see how this goes :|. :D  - - It's the one at the school...then we will hit my sister's pool after that.</p>
                <p>Speaking of pools - the pool opens this weekend, that should be good for some distraction this week.</p>
                <p> I'm so afraid I'm going to be looking back through old messages and accidently like something you said or comment something random, or a complete book, on accident ;). I can do this. I can hold off to be friends down the road.</p>
                <p>1:20PM - Just got back from lunch. Had to walk to the bank to pay our car taxes...had chicken for lunch - I know - surprise surprise!</p>
                <p>3:20 PM - A Tear In Space just came on. That hit me hard...too hard. I'm feeling it now. What happens after two weeks? Are we even going to be friends? I mean, I know I want to be friends. I guess I'm just not sure I've had anyone express that they've wanted to be friends before and that kind of threw me when you first said it. I don't know. Now I'm getting in my own head. Let's see where we are at two weeks.</p>
                <p>Ran two miles tonight. Looking at that 5K so I need to run further or faster over the coming week or two to get up to speed. Graduation is next Friday! that is crazy. 20 something years in the making and it's almost here. Not completely done with school and working on the paper that is due this week....Good distraction - sometimes not good enough but good distraction nonetheless</p>
                <p>10:30 - wrapping up homework for the day. Forgot to say this earlier...T is making fun of me today... She messaged and said "I waved to H today lol". I told her she was wierd because she has waived to a lot of people all the time. Why did she feel the need to tell me this one? She just said she thought it was funny because of everything going on...so... :D I'm laughing at it but - oh brother.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/27/2025</p> 
                <p>Woke up this morning - feeling good. I'm down 25lbs. Not going to hit the 50lb goal but hoping to try to drop another 10 by graduation. I have renewed hope that we can be friends. Just get through these 2 weeks and there's nothing to it - right?</p>
                <p>Going to North Hills this morning. Have to talk to one of the pastors to renew our membership since we were gone for 2+ years. Should be a good day overall.</p>
                <p>Have 2 papers to finish for today, 1 paper & 1 exam I need to finish for this upcoming week, then one 10-15 page paper I need to complete next week and I'm done with these classes. Crazy. Then there is one more class left to take. A lot riding on this week...maybe that is why I can't talk to you, so I focus on my schoolwork...I didn't think you were THAT much of a distraction LOL.</p>
                <p>Get through today and there's only one more Sunday to get through...I got this.</p>
                <p>Why am I sooo anxious today? I have literally felt like I'm in fight mode all morning. I'm sure my schoolwork has a little to play into that but I've got plenty of time today. I haven't even been procrastinating. I just feel it all in my gut. You would probably be able to pinpoint it with a few questions...never was sure how you did that...</p>
                <p>One of the papers I have is a review of the internship. Man, you left a lot of little memories all over the place - Cpt. Sparkles. It was a good time. A lot of being able to help everyone and I enjoyed just about every minute of it. 12 days until graduation, 13 days until....(shrugs) I guess we'll see.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think back on whether you told me you were going to the art show or not...I thought I remember you saying you would be out of town or I completely didn't hear what you said at all... Maybe the latter, T says I can't ever hear anything - IDK.</p>
                <p>You asked me how I'd do with it if it didn't turn out favorably...:( I keep coming back to, I brushed the dust off those doors and opened them up. I wouldn't love it, I wouldn't even like it or want to pretend to like it. I can't force it to happen - so while it might suck more than anything - we know I'll eventually be alright. At some point down the road, I think it will happen.</p>
                <p>My question will be, can I wish you happy BDay? Can I interact with you on LI? All these things that I consider to be humans interacting with each other, am I just not going to be allowed to interact with you??????</p>
                <p>Almost through the first Sunday. Going to go run in a minute and then finish and turn in this last paper due today... Met with one of the elders at church so we can continue to be members at North Hills.it was a good meeting.</p>
                <p>Got some stuff going on that I don't know how to deal with. Would love to talk through it. Maybe this is the list we talk through in 2 weeks...hopefully.... fingers crossed. - I just want to feel like everything I do isn't criticized by people.</p>
                <p>Ok, One of the two Sundays under my belt. I hope you are doing ok. It was good to talk to you yesterday and get the update of how things were really from Friday night.</p>
                <p>9:30PM - Time for bed. First Sunday in the bags. Night</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/26/2025</p> 
                <p>Well, we saw you guys at the art show last night. Probably haven't felt that uncomfortable for some time. It was obvious there was not a single ounce that wanted to talk to me or be in that situation from someone. :(. Hope is fading. I'm trying to be ok with it. I truly am. T is great about it. She says I haven't been myself for the last two years and the last few months have been good. I think it is because I opened myself up. That comes with a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Once you open something that hasn't been opened for a while, something has to rush in. Right now, I need to find something to fill that space. It is currently being occupied by loneliness and sadness. i told this to A. I think he is going to be a good one. :) So much pulled out in the first session already.</p>
                <p>I sent you an email, then I recalled it...I am not sure you wanted it</p>
                <p>Just got a Teams message from you. Things make more sense on a lot of fronts. </p>
                <p>It was great talking to you today. I have so much more I want to tell you</p>
                <p>Therapy was Friday. We hit a number of things right out of the gate. Think there is a good game plan going forward. You wouldn't be surprised by some of it. I'm too skeptical to think any one person is always right but Im starting to wonder...</p>
                <p>Ok, so ironically, this ultimatum (is that the right word) is the same thing we just tried, but this feels different. This is a goal and I obliterate goals. This fuels me and it will be worth it in the end. Again though, funny that it's the same thing we tried and failed at 3 days in...</p>
                <p>Get through today then two more Saturdays. I won't reach out until at least 5/11... I won't reach out... I've got this.</p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/25/2025</p>
                <p>Saw Adam today. had some good conversations. I know emailing you wasn't what you wanted. I am not expecting you to write back. I just feel lonely for the first time in my life. How does coming out of whatever the last two years into this feeling...how is that supposed to feel ok, or normal? I'm glad I switched (back to the Adam part) I think this session went super quick but had good results already.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                <p>4/24/2025</p> 
                <p>Ok, I made it through yesterday without reaching out. This will be hard but the selfish part of me wants to question, how will I know when, or even IF, I can reach out again...if ever? All the dumb things I want to say to someone and they are too dumb for most people to have time for...I guess you never probably had time for them either but you entertained them :D. I miss being able to just throw those in chat and let a conversation play out.</p>
                <p>They let another round of people go from work. I don't know why they could have done it all at the same time. Completely killing the moral of the office everytime this happens and it's now been twice in a 2-week period.</p>
                <p>I guess we are going to the art show on Friday. Second oldest says she has a piece that is entered and so we'll be there. Also, little man starts up soccer on Monday with the school. Guess it is going to be a busy week.</p>
                <p>I'm so unmotivated today</p>
                <p>God's delays are not necessarily denials....:(</p>
                <p>Don't waste the waiting...Please act on my behalf as I wait on you...</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>4/23/2025</p>
                <p>Ok, I archived the rest of this. Figured I would start over since I'm in a different headspace. I'm sad. Not distraught or anything... but sad.</p>
                <p>I tried to stop and think about this from another approach. What’s the worst that could happen after some time of not talking? So I'll write through that.</p>
                <p>In my mind, the worst that could happen is that you forget about me, and we’re never friends again, and I never find another friend who’s easy to talk to and understands my quirks :). Is that unrealistic? Maybe... I just know it takes a lot for me to let anyone past that circle of acquaintances. I let you in and now I have to intentionally keep you out. That feels like ripping out a piece of me. Maybe that is dramatic but it's honest. I guess the next worse thing is we are able to continue talking and you find out I'm boring. Then we were able to talk but you don't want to. Goes back to losing a friend, or I guess what I thought was a friend. Still the same amount of hurt and opening myself up to be hurt. I don't like that. It doesn't feel good.</p>
                <p>You say two weeks and it will feel better. Again, it isn't about being sad, it's about finding a friend that I let in, that I can't be friends with. I don't know how long that feeling will last. There are a lot of aquaintances that are nice to hang out with and nice to have around...</p>
                <p>Got the bloodwork done yesterday. I have hope that they will find something with this. If this is Addison's - I'm reaching out...Screw anything - I'm reaching out. </p>
                <p>12:32PM - I'm here at work, trying to find something INTERESTING to keep me occupied. I can do all this work I just want to be jovial with someone. Ok, what do I need to do....tonight when I get home, I need to start 3 large papers. probably not all at once but finding that motiviation is extremely hard today. I keep hoping you'll reach out with an update. It's only been 1 full day so far though. </p>
                <p>I've gone to lunch alone before - today seems different. Listening to Coldplay - Fix you...seems sad enough without getting too far off that cliff.</p>
                <p>1:39PM - back from lunch. Thinking you are getting ready for your 1:1. praying for you. Feeling off right now, hoping I clear the rest of the day. I have an eye appointment around 4 then need to fill my evening with things to do for school and getting ready for the weekend.</p>
                <p>3:32PM - praying for you, right now. Thinking about that one thing you mentioned that I wasn't quite sure about (hadn't ever thought about it before). Listening to videos on it. Not sure I follow how I resemble that but should have asked you if you saw that.</p>
